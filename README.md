# CLI-commands
Collection of useful commands


I'm collecting tons of useful commands that we can use to pull information around endpoints using CLI interfaces. Each of the files in this repo are pre-set commands or small script snippets.

If you have a request or specific idea please post an issue and I'll see if I can get a search or PowerShell result to pull that data to you.


<h2>My Goal</h2>
My Goal of this repo is to help MSP and IT Admins query their environment to troubleshoot things all behind the scenes rather than interrupting the end user's workflow by connecting to their machine.
